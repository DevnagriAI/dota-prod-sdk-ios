    let strStringToTranslate = "Defining English literacy is a difficult and contentious task. In simple terms, the question 'What is literacy?' often prompts the answer 'the ability to read and write.' However, literacy is more accurately characterized as the ability to effectively use language to accomplish your goals in the social setting you are in. In short, literacy is perhaps the most important skill in modern society: those whose reading and writing skills are not sufficient for success in education or employment will be left behind.  Children who enter the school system with a level of English literacy substantially lower than that of their peers are often termed English language learners or English learners, and research has established that their entire future depends on whether they make up this literacy deficit"
